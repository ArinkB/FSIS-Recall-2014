# PythonDataAnalysis
Code-Lou Python class

Hello Fellow Coder,

In order to test out my Python Dataset code you need to:
- Clone my repo:
  - Open Gitbash and make sure you are in the directory that you want to clone my repo to
  - type "git clone https://github.com/ArinkB/PythonDataAnalysis.git" then enter
  - congrats my repo has been cloned to your local computer
 
- To test my dataset:
  - Launch Jupyter Notebook.
  - Once launched please navigate to the location that you saved my repo to within Jupyter ex: Desktop > PythonDataAnalysis.
  - Select and double click the file named "FSIS-Recall-Summary-2014.ipynb" to open
  - Select the last code section that says "df.sample(10)"
  - Click on  to " >| Run " to run the code
  - End result should be seeing a dataset at the bottom with 10 samples, mostly food stuff recalls

Thank you !!
