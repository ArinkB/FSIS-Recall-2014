# PythonDataAnalysis
Code-Lou Python class

Hello Fellow Coder,

In order to test out my Python Dataset code you need to:
- Launch Jupyter Notebook.
- Once launched please navigate to the location that you saved my repo to within Jupyter ex: Desktop > PythonDataAnalysis.
- Select and double click the file named "FSIS-Recall-Summary-2014.ipynb" to open
- Select the last code section that says "df.sample(10)"
- Click on  to " >| Run " to run the code
- End result should be seeing a dataset at the bottom with 10 samples, mostly food stuff recalls

Thank you !!
